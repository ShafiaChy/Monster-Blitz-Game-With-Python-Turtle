# Monster Blitz.




## About my project
<ol>
    <li>It is a simple shooting game made with Python Turtle library.</li>
    <li>It is similar to the game Space Invader but some significant changes has been made.</li>
    <li>The game has a score board where the score gets updated each the player shoots.</li>
    <li>Collision math has been implemented hence if the player collides with an enemy or any other obstacles, the game end.</li>
    <li>If the enemies collide with any obstacles (excluding the player), they will respawn.</li>
    <li>The assets used here are borrowed.</li>
</ol>
